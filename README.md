# Go Projects

This is a set of folders/files that I've been building as I've been learning the Go programming language

# Learning that I've completed
- https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-go-24516285/learn-to-program-with-go - I started learning Go by watching this Intro to the Go Programming Language on LinkedIn Learning 
- https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests - This is a really highly recommended book that teaches Go via Test Driven Development (TDD)

# Folder Structure
- learn_go_with_tests - This is the set of files that I built when going through Learning Go With Tests
- summarizer - I'm rebuilding a real application from my work with the Go programming language. I've changed around a lot of structure to fit Go's design practices & be cleaner code. There's a README walking through how the application works
- http_calls_with_go_routines - A simple file that I was using to test go routines
- playground - Just a set of random files so I have a local REPL'
